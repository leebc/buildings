The mansion Iâ€™m writing about is called Villa Luginsland, once the residence of the German consul Baron Max Von Tucker. He served in Malta in the early 20th century and during that time Von Tucker commissioned the architect Francesco Zammit to build the amazing villa.

Von Tucher commissioned the architect Francesco Zammit to build the striking Villa Luginsland, in Boscetto Road, Rabat.
